visitors rocked \u2013 and that served as a warning sign of what was to follow.<\/p>\n\n<p>In their first match without Irish midfielder Denise O\u2019Sullivan following the end of her guest player contract, Western Sydney failed to stamp their mark on the game as Dawber\u2019s 17th-minute strike and Weber\u2019s late first-half double left Wanderers reeling at the interval.<\/p>\n\n<p>The visitors continued to be carved open in the second half but some desperate defending kept Western Sydney from further embarrassment until their late rally, but it was not enough to deny Adelaide one of the\u00a0upsets of the 2019\/20 season.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.w-league.com.au\/news\/every-westfield-w-league-201920-season-match-watch-live-and-free\"><img alt=\"Watch live and free\"

started the day as winless cellar dwellers, but the Lady Reds opened in confident fashion with American attacker Weber racing through on goal and drawing a rash foul from back-up goalkeeper Newbon, who received a yellow card on her second Westfield W-League start in relief of the injured United States custodian Abby Smith after two minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>There were more nervous moments for Western Sydney in the sixth minute when Weber stole the ball from Alex Huynh and Condon crashed a shot against the top of the visitors\u2019 crossbar, but the Golden-clad Wanderers finally threatened on 15 minutes when stand-in right-back Amy Harrison found Kirsten Hamilton and her driven delivery flashed past both Courtnee Vine and the home goal.<\/p>\n\n<article class=\"embedded-entity\"><div>\n

goals from Sam Staab and an own goal from Lais Araujo made it a nervy finish at the Marden Sports Complex.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Kristen Hamilton had skied\u00a0an 81st-minute penalty with the score still at 3-0 and Amy Harrison lashed a 95th minute volley over the crossbar as the out-of-sorts Westfield W-League title challengers fell to a second defeat in three games.<\/p>\n\n<p>A sudden slip in form leaves Dean Heffernan\u2019s second-placed side trailing Melbourne City by six points with three games to play \u2013 but the Red and Black remain in the mix to claim their first ever Finals Series berth.<\/p>\n\n<p>The rock bottom side stunned the competition high fliers from the off with their crisp passing and fluid movement as Emily Condon rattled the crossbar on six minutes to leave the visitors rocked \u2013 and that served as a warning sign of what was to follow.<\/p>\n\n<p>In their first match without Irish midfielder Denise O\u2019Sullivan following the end of her guest player contract, Western Sydney failed to stamp their mark on the game as Dawber\u2019s 17th-minute strike and Weber\u2019s late first-half double left Wanderers reeling at the interval.<\/p>\n\n<p>The visitors continued to be carved open in the second half but some desperate defending kept Western Sydney from further embarrassment until their late rally, but it was not enough to deny Adelaide one of the\u00a0upsets of the 2019\/20 season.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.w-league.com.au\/news\/every-westfield-w-league-201920-season-match-watch-live-and-free\"><img alt=\"Watch live and free\"

started the day as winless cellar dwellers, but the Lady Reds opened in confident fashion with American attacker Weber racing through on goal and drawing a rash foul from back-up goalkeeper Newbon, who received a yellow card on her second Westfield W-League start in relief of the injured United States custodian Abby Smith after two minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>There were more nervous moments for Western Sydney in the sixth minute when Weber stole the ball from Alex Huynh and Condon crashed a shot against the top of the visitors\u2019 crossbar, but the Golden-clad Wanderers finally threatened on 15 minutes when stand-in right-back Amy Harrison found Kirsten Hamilton and her driven delivery flashed past both Courtnee Vine and the home goal.<\/p>\n\n<article class=\"embedded-entity\"><div>\n

Incredibly, the 13-goal City marksman could only direct a tame effort into the arms of Glory 'keeper Liam Reddy.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Reddy was called into action again 10 minutes later. A wonderful move from City saw Maclaren teed up Adrian Luna, and the Perth shot-stopper \u2013 who had kept five clean sheets in six prior to kick off \u2013 lept acrobatically to his right.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<article class=\"embedded-entity\"><div>\n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-video-embed-field field--type-video-embed-field field--label-hidden field__item\"><div class=\"video-embed-field-provider-brightcove video-embed-field-responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" src=\"\/\/players.brightcove.net\/5519514571001\/default_default\/index.html?videoId=6126453687001\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n      \n  <\/div>\n    <\/article><p><br \/><strong>Fornaroli and Castro cannot find the breakthrough for Perth<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Bruno Fornaroli will want this attempt again.\u00a0The ex-City talisman's diminutive frame emerged amid Perth's tall timber to get on the end of Neil Kilkenny's corner but the headed finish from the Uruguayan was wayward.<\/p>\n\n<p>Diego Castro perhaps should have done better with the best chance Glory constructed in the opening stanza.
